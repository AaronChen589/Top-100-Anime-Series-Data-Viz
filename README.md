# Top-100-AnimeList-Data-Viz


# Background
The stake holder is an avid anime fan that wants you to create an interactive dashboard on Tableau that analyzes his/her top 100 most favorite anime. He/she had made a top 100 list on imdb: https://www.imdb.com/list/ls057577566/ 
and wants you to do the following with it...

* Webscrape, data wrangle and preprocess his list of top 100 anime through Python
* Verify the accuracy of the dataset through SQL/Python
* The dashboard should include the following features below:
  - Top Rated Anime: A bar chart or a table showing the top-rated anime based on their IMDb ratings. This can give an overview of the highest-rated anime in the list.

  - Distribution of Ratings: A histogram or a box plot showing the distribution of ratings across all anime. This can help me understand the overall rating distribution of my favorite anime.

  - Aired Duration vs. Average Runtime: A scatter plot showing the relationship between the duration an anime aired and its average runtime. This can help me see if there's any correlation between the duration an anime aired and its runtime.

  - Genre Distribution: A pie chart or a bar chart showing the distribution of genres among my favorite anime. This can give insights into the types of genres I tend to enjoy the most.

  - MPAA Rating Distribution: A bar chart showing the distribution of MPAA ratings among my favorite anime. This can provide insights into the age appropriateness of the anime I enjoy.

  - Votes vs. Rating: A scatter plot showing the relationship between the number of votes an anime received and its rating. This can help me understand if there's any correlation between the popularity of an anime and its rating.

  - Time Series Analysis: A line chart showing the trend of IMDb ratings over time for the top-rated anime. This can help me see if there are any trends or patterns in the ratings of my favorite anime over time.

  - Comparative Analysis: Side-by-side bar charts comparing the ratings, aired duration, average runtime, etc., of different anime. This can help me compare the characteristics of different anime at a glance.
